# origin_to_base

A simple Blender addon to move mesh data center to the bottom.
The addon adds to Blender 2 operators (no GUI needed):
- origin_to_base_volume
- origin_to_base_vertices

## Origin to base (volume)

Moves the mesh origin to the bottom center of surrounding volume.

## Origin to base (vertices)

Moves the mesh origin to the center of bottom vertices.

### How to use

You need at least one mesh selected.
Open the functions search popup (usually with **F3** key unless you changed the shortcut) and search for: _origin to base_ then select the operator you want to use.
